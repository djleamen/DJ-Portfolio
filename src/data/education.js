    { name: "Computer Architecture", description: "This course introduces the basic ideas of computer organization and underlying digital logic that implements a computer system. Starting from representation of information, the course looks at logic elements used for storing and processing information. The course also discusses how the information storage and processing elements are linked together to function as a computer system. Students become familiar with the basic hardware components of a system and how they are connected, and see how secondary storage, registers and control units must co-ordinate to provide an effective environment for application programming. The components of a multi-level memory, and how it interfaces with the I/O and central processor, are examined.", show: false },
